# Release Notes for OBS 2.0.8
#

Updaters from 2.0.X can just update the packages and restart all services.
Updaters from former releases need to check the 2.0.0 Release Notes file.

Changes since 2.0.7:
====================

Fixes:
* api: security fix for a leak which could be used to modify or remove projects
       or packages without sufficiant permissions.
* api: new users get a valid state now 
       (using iChain authentification only or the Admin is creating them manually)
