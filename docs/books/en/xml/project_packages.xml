  <title>Contents of Packages</title>
  <para>
   The contents of a package consists of files necessary to build an RPM or DEB
   package, such as spec files, tar.bz2 archive files containing the source
   code of a program, or patch files needed to adjust a program as needed for a
   distribution.
  </para>

  <para>It is also possible to "link" package from another project into your
  own project.  This way you can save space on the server and do not need to
  maintain the source and control files for this package yourself.  You will
  inherit all foreign changes automatically.
</para>

 <sect2 id="sec.project_structure.packages.meta">
