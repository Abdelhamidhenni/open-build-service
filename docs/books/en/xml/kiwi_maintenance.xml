 <title>Maintaining Operating System Images</title>
 <abstract>
  <para> The creation of an operating system image usually results in a specific appliance solution
   for a particular customer or group of customers. But software develops, and you don't want your
   solution to become outdated. This section give you some idea on how to maintain images created by
   KIWI. </para>

  <title>Software Changes</title>
  <para>The first reason for updating an image is changes to the software (for example, a new kernel
   should be used). If this change does not require additional software or changes to the system
   configuration, you can use the KIWI <option>upgrade</option> option to perform the update. </para>
  <para>KIWI also lets you add an additional repository which might be needed if the updated
   software is not part of the original repository. It is important to note that this additional
   repository is <emphasis>not</emphasis> stored in the image description�s original
    <filename>config.xml</filename> file.</para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2 id="sec.kiwi.maintenance.configuration">
  <title>Configuration Changes or Enhancements</title>
  <para>Another reason for updating a software image is configuration changes or enhancements (for
   example, an image replaced its browser with a better browser, or a new service such as Apache
   should be enabled). While it is possible to do these kind of changes manually within the physical
   extend, we don�t recommend it because it leaves the system in an unversioned condition, and no
   one would know what changes were made since the image was initially created.</para>
  <para>Changes to the image configuration should be done within the image description. The image
   description itself should be part of a versioning system such as Subversion, which lets you keep
   track of changes and assign them to product tags and branches. This means that images must be
   prepared from scratch and the old physical extend should be removed.</para>
