 <title>Maintenance of Operating System Images</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   Creating an image often results in an appliance solution for a customer and
   gives you the freedom of a working solution at that time. But software
   develops and you don't want your solution to become outdated. Because of
   this together with an image people always should think of
   <quote>image-maintenance</quote>. The following paragraph just reflects
   ideas how to maintain images created by KIWI.

  The picture above shows two possible scenarios which requires an image to
  become updated. The first reason for updating an image are changes to the
  software, for example a new kernel should be used. If this change doesn't
  require additional software or changes in the configuration the update can
  be done by KIWI itself using its <option>upgrade</option> option. In
  combination with <option>upgrade</option> KIWI allows to add an additional
  repository which may be needed if the updated software is not part of the
  original repository. An important thing to know is that this additional
  repository is <emphasis>not</emphasis> stored into the original
  <filename>config.xml</filename> file of the image description.
 </para>
 <para>
  Another reason for updating an image beside software updates are
  configuration changes or enhancements, for example an image should have
  replaced its browser with another better browser or a new service like
  apache should be enabled. In principal it's possible to do all those changes
  manually within the physical extend but concerning maintenance this would be
  a nightmare. Why, because it will leave the system in an unversioned
  condition. Nobody knows what has changed since the very first preparation of
  this image. So in short <emphasis>dont't modify physical extends
   manually</emphasis>. Changes to the image configuration should be done
  within the image description. The image description itself should be part of
  a versioning system like subversion. All changes can be tracked down then
  and maybe more important can be assigned to product tags and branches. As a
  consequence an image must be prepared from scratch and the old physical
  extend could be removed.
