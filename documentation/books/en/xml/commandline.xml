  toms 2007-07-30 (Idea): Could we mention the tool "webpin"?
                          It is a really sophisticated tool that 
                          is not only available via Web but also
                          as a separate RPM package. It let you
                          search for packages on different openSUSE
                          repositories.

 <title>Using the Command Line Client</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   Many developers who want to maintain multiple packages do not like
   graphical frontends. The reasons for this range from uncomfortable
   mouse handling to the need to work on systems remotely, which is
   often easier to accomplish on a shell. To make this comfort also
   available to the &bs;, a command line client,
   <quote>osc</quote> was developed.
  </para>
 </abstract>

 <para>
  All actions on the &bs; require an authentication of the
  user. The &bs; uses the same account that is also used on the
  OpenSUSE wiki, found at <ulink url="www.opensuse.org"/>. If you do
  not yet have an account, create on on this page. 
 </para>
 <para>
  The command line utility osc is available in the &bs;. To install
  this utility, add the catalog 
  <literal>http://software.opensuse.org/download/openSUSE:/Tools/&lt;product&gt;</literal>
  to your installation sources where <quote>product</quote> is the
  installed operating system version. osc will then be available in your
  preferred installer. 
 </para>
 <para>
  When using the osc command for the first time, you will be prompted for
  your username and password. This is then stored in a file that is
  only readable by the current user, and is found at
  <filename>${HOME}/.oscrc</filename>.
 </para>
 <para>
  One of the first tasks is, to get a working copy of the home project
  of your user. To do this, change your working directory into a
  directory where you want to keep all the &bs; projects. Then run the
  command <command>osc co home:&lt;username&gt;</command>. The first
  time you do this, you will probably get only an empty directory.
  However, if you already used the web interface as described in
  <xref linkend="sec.webclient.project"/>, you will also get all
  existing packages of your home project.
