Fri Mar 16 16:17:13 +0100 2007 - bauersman

- update from svn revision 1422 to 1458
- fix for superclass mismatch when using rails from vendor directory
  added action_cache plugin, necessary because the standard rails caching
  mechanism lacks some important features we need here like:
  
- recognition of 'Content-Type: application/xml' (rails built-in caching
    can only handle text/html resp. assumes that all _is_ text/html)
- time based cache expiration (time to live mechanism)
- recognition of parameters (standard rails caching treats /some/url the
    same like /some/url?param=value)
- 
  * webclient:
  - display most_active statistics in two columns when in detailed mode
  - adjusted activexml-config for new frontend-routes
  - adjusted all activexml-find calls where necessary to use new routes
  - re-activated activity statistics, because they should be much faster
    now (see below)
  
  * frontend:
  - re-implemented complete activity measurement: this is now mainly
    calculated by the sql-database - and is much faster now :)
  - use the new action_cache plugin for caching most of the statistics
    xml output. this speeds up statistics even more.
  
- reduced necessary sql requests for latest_added statistics -> faster
  
- reduced necessary sql requests for latest_updated statistics
- only get necessary sql fields, should save a bit memory
  


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Mar 19 18:16:17 +0100 2007 - bauersman

- update from svn revision 1459 to 1471

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Mar 20 21:52:33 +0100 2007 - bauersman

- update from svn revision 1489 to 1497
- patched result_controller to look for binarylist elements instead of rpmlist
  
- replaced complete redirect_stats action, which takes download_stats
  from redirector as xml and fills up the frontend database.
  -> now we use a rexml streamparser, which needs much less memory
  and is much faster than the rexml tree-based method used before.
- rewritten download_counter action: optimized a lot for speed by using
  more of the sql database functions
- renamed some parameters to be more obvious ('concat' is now 'group_by')
- removed no longer necessary functions
