High priority:
==============
- repository deletion
- job scheduler with priorities
- quota handling (size of project repos)
- enable all build hosts with XEN
- find a solution for provo instance updates
  (Allow binary rpm upload via API ?)

Medium priority:
================
- release numbers:
  - over src links
  - track other packages? (kernel folks want this)
- .changes integration
- src diffs
- src copy (or should this happen on API / client side ?)
  - with src link handling 
- build job replacement because of new changes
  - terminate running build?
    - build time quota ?
- clarify how to store patterns and distribution descriptions (KIWI)
- disable / manual package release mechanism
- xml data cleanup, remove unused fields
- fast boot strapping
- Submit sources from autobuild STABLE for Factory / Core
  * only read-only mode in first step
  * possibility to merge back contributions as second step

Low priority:
=============
- rebuild reason logging
- renaming
  - packages (this is easy)
  - repositories?
  - projects?
- build still idle check
- build still running check
