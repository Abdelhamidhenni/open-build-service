To setup an own backend:

1) Change BSConfig.pm to match your local paths and server names.
   Currently the server runs with user "bsrun" and group "bsrun",
   so you have to add them to your system.
2) run a src server:
   ./bs_srcserver
3) run a repo server:
   ./bs_repserver
4) run a job scheduler for every arch you need
   ./bs_sched i586
   ./bs_sched x86_64
   ...
5) create a directory "build" and check out the current version of the
   build scripts from novellforge:
   https://forgesvn1.novell.com/svn/opensuse/trunk/buildservice/src/backend/build
5) on your build clients:
   create a directory /root/bs
   copy BSBuild.pm BSConfig.pm BSDEBQ.pm BSHTTP.pm BSRPC.pm BSServer.pm
   BSUtil.pm BSXML.pm XML/Structured.pm bs_build bs_buildhelper bs_worker
   into the directory.
   create a work directory, e.g. /BUILD/root_1
   create a state dir, e.g. /var/run/worker_1
   run ./bs_worker --root /BUILD/root_1 --id <hostname>/1 --statedir /var/run/worker_1
