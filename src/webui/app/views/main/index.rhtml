<h1 class="mainhead">Welcome to the openSUSE Build Service</h1>

<p class="description">This is the first preview of the openSUSE Build Service Frontend. It can
build packages for various distributions. Most of the advanced features are
still missing, but the basic build functionality is there.</p>

<p class="description">More information can be found in the openSUSE Wiki on the <a
href="http://www.opensuse.org/Build_Service">Build Service pages</a>. If you would like to discuss the Build Service
please use the <a href="mailto:opensuse-buildservice-subscribe@opensuse.org">opensuse-buildservice@opensuse.org</a> mailing
