This release is primarly driven by the parties of the
MeeGo project.

It will offer a 1.7 code base with following additional 
features.

* ACL read permission check
* permission support for groups (backport from master)

An api database migration is needed after updating from

read README.UPDATERS file in that case.

OBS Appliance users get all needed update steps automatically
after upgrading their appliance. This can be done either
via package upgrade or via replacing the appliance image.
