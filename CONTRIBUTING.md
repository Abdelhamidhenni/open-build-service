# Request for contributions
We are always looking for contributions to the Open Build Service. Read this guide on how to do that. 

In particular, this community seeks the following types of contributions:

* code: contribute your expertise in an area by helping us expand OSEM
* ideas: participate in an issues thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
* copy editing: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content of OSEM

# How to contribute
* Prerequisites: familiarity with [GitHub Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and issues.
* Fork the repository and make a pull-request with your changes
  * Please make sure to mind what our test suite in [travis](https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/open-build-service) tells you! :-)
  * Please increase our [code coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/openSUSE/open-build-service) by your pull request!

* One of the OSEM maintainers will review your pull-request
  * If you are already a contributor (means you're in the [open-build-service team](https://github.com/orgs/openSUSE/teams/open-build-service)) and you get a positive review, you can merge your pull-request yourself
  * If you are not a contributor already the reviewer will merge your pull-request
