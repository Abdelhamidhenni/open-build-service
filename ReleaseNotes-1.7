Please note that the new SLP service discovery support is
recommended to be used. bs_worker instances will find all
OBS server instances in the entire network. You can disable
this via syconfig settings:

The former called "webclient" is now called "webui".

 * Rewritten dependency solver in scheduler which gave
   a significant speed up.

 * Attribute system to store all kind of information for projects 
   and packages as defined by the server admin.

 * Extended request handling
   - new request types (delete or change_devel)
   - new review mechanism

 * clean product build support (inside of chroot enviroment)

 * Improved source handling of branched packages (less often 
   created conflicts).

   prepare sources in the same way.
