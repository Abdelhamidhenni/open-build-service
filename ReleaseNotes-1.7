# Release Notes for openSUSE Build Service 1.7     (PRE-RELEASE)
#

Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions.

README.UPDATE has informations for updaters.

Please note that the new SLP service discovery support is
recommended to be used. bs_worker instances will find all
OBS server instances in the entire network. You can disable
this via syconfig settings:
  /etc/sysconfig/obs-server
  /etc/sysconfig/obs-worker

Main new features are:

 * Rewritten dependency solver in scheduler which gave
   a significant speed up.

 * Attribute system to store all kind of information for projects 
   and packages as defined by the server admin.
