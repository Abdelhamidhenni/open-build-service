Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions.

Please note that the new SLP service discovery support is
recommended to be used. bs_worker instances will find all
OBS server instances in the entire network. You can disable
this via syconfig settings:
  /etc/sysconfig/obs-server

The former called "frontend" is now called "api".
The former called "webclient" is now called "webui".

New processes are

 * bs_signerd
   Needed when a signing key is configured in BSConfig.pm

 * bs_warden
   Optionally, detects hanging build hosts

 * delayed_jobs
   Needed to run regular jobs on api instance which creates
   cache content.

 * Cron jobs

 * Rewritten dependency solver in scheduler which gave
   a significant speed up.

   and packages as defined by the server admin.

   - new request types (delete or change_devel)
   - new review mechanism

 * Improved source handling of branched packages (less often 
   created conflicts).

   prepare sources in the same way.
