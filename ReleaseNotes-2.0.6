# Release Notes for OBS 2.0.6
#

Updaters from 2.0.X can just update the packages and restart all services.
Updaters from former releases need to check the 2.0.0 Release Notes file.

The api should get migrated via 

 # cd /srv/www/obs/api/
 # RAILS_ENV="production" rake db:migrate
 # chown -R lighttpd.lighttpd log
