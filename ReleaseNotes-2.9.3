Features
=======

Backend:
  * Allow to use different scheduling strategy which handles large build dependency cycles
    better. Enable it via project config:

      BuildFlags: genmetaalgo:1

Bugfixes
========

Frontend:
  * Fixes permission issue that allowd unpermitted users to trigger services via the webui.
  * Permits setting the initial bs request state. This prevents setting the initial state
    to something else than 'new' (CVE-2018-7689).
  * Fixes permission check for project with 'InitializeDevelPackage' attribute (CVE-2018-7688).
  * Fixes rendering of requests with multiple submit requests. Previously switching tabs would
    not trigger a reload of the request content for the selected request.

Backend:
  * Debian fixes to 2.9 - publish ONIE binary and hashsum, enable Secure Boot EFI signing for Debian packages.
  * New regex needssslcertforbuild for Debian builds
  * Support publishing via rsync syntax (allows to specify port numbers)
  * Make project config parser errors always visible
  * Fix corner case on wiping binaries
  * Improved .changes merge handling
  * Don't publish unneeded files of appdata in meta data
  * Fixing lost events on restarting schedulers
  * Make errors by not reachable remote instances better visible.
