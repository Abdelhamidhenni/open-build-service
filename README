======================
openSUSE Build Service
======================

The openSUSE Build Service (OBS) is an open and complete distribution
development platform designed to encourage developers to compile packages for
multiple Linux distributions including openSUSE, Red Hat, Mandriva, Ubuntu,
Fedora and Debian. It typically simplifies the packaging process, so developers
can more easily package a single program for many distributions, and many
openSUSE releases, making more packages available to users regardless of what
distribution they use.


Organization
============

The openSUSE Build Service consists of several parts, namely the backend, the
api and the webui. The backend implements all the core functionality (i.e. the
business logic), whereas the webui provides a neat browser interface. The api
forms the glue between those components and also serves as the integration
point to other external tools (hence it's name). Therefore the source code is
organized like this:

 dist/          - Helpful scripts and utilities
 docs/          - Documentation and examples
 src/api/       - Api code (Ruby / Ruby on Rails)
 src/backend/   - Backend code (Perl)
 src/webui/     - Webui code (Ruby / Ruby on Rails)
 shared/        - Stuff shared across the different parts

Note that the three parts each also have their own documentation found in their
respective subdirectories.


Licensing
=========

The openSUSE Build Service is Free Software and is released under the terms of
the GPL, except where noted. Additionally, 3rd-party content (like, but not
exclusively, the webui icon theme) may be released under a different license.
Please check the respective files for details.
