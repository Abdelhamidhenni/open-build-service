  from user accounts
* [webui] LDAP Authentication is now officially supported

Changes:

* Realname and email address of users can not be edited in LDAP mode

Bugfixes:
=========

* [webui] Admins that edited their accounts via the user/show page lost their admin role

Notes for OBS setups with LDAP authentication:
==============================================

run following commands:

'cd /srv/www/obs/api'

'bundle exec rake user:give_admin_rights tux RAILS_ENV=production'
