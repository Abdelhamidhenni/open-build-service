# Release Notes for OBS 2.0.4
#

Updaters from 2.0.X can just update the packages and restart all services.
Updaters from former releases need to check the 2.0.0 Release Notes file.

Changes since 2.0.3:
====================

Changes:
* api/backend: support to extend experation date for pgp keys
* OBS is now compatible with Rails 2.3.5 and 2.3.8
* correct session key in api and webui, it can be stored in a config/secret.key file now
  (this is no security leak, because session data is stored in MySQL and therefore not reachable)
* Adding Mandriva 2010.1 to default targets

Fixes:
* api: correct handling of source files which contain special characters like hashes
* backend: filter broken SLP announcements to "localhost"
