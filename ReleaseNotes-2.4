# Open Build Service 2.4

Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/OBS-Appliance

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace 
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will 
happen automatically.


Temporary Problems:
===================

 * No gui interface for managing users and groups. api
   routes have to be enhanced and webui needs to get support 
   for using it.

Changes on purpose:
===================

 * Migration to Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.2

 * request database got move from backend to the api. Directly
   after update all requests seem to have vanished, but a delayed
   job is importing them again. This can take some hours dependening
   on the amount of requests.

 * package meta of package copy command is not copying 
  relationships and devel definitions anymore

 * Requests do require a description now in any case

 * webui configurations got moved from environments/*.rb to config/options.yml.
   TODO: import config settings on update
