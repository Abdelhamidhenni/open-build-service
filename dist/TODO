- clean up config

   - centralize in one place, like /etc/sysconfig/obs, that is used by
     everything

      - service locations
      - directories

- clean up log files

   - centralize in /srv/obs/log or even better /var/log/obs/

- start in screen

   - see obsworker for how so
   - document

- split package along the lines of 'can run on own machine'

- clean up source package

   - remove stale files

   - figure how rails apps are usually maintained / installed and how
     that maps to rpm distributed apps

   - take files from tar ball instead of %SOURCE xyz, move them into
     a subdir for that.

- add sandboxed smoke test

   - start a build service and test build "hello.rpm" or
     "obs-server.src.rpm" in it

- fix ports

   currently:
     5352 -> SR in Hex "source repo"
     5252 -> RR in Hex "rpm repo"

     6352, 6252 have been internal test instances
   So there is no need to stay with the existing port numbers while
   finding more appropriate official ones.

- "deleted" project in the backend is a feature...
