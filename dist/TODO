- clean up config

- clean up log files

- start in screen

- fix ports

  currently:
    5352 -> SR in Hex "source repo"
    5252 -> RR in Hex "rpm repo"

    6352, 6252 have been internal test instances
  So there is no need to stay with the existing port numbers while
  finding more appropriate official ones.

- "deleted" project in the backend is a feature...
