# openSUSE Build Service 2.4.2
#

Updaters from any OBS 2.4 release can just ugrade the packages
and restart all services. Updaters from former releases should
read the README.UPDATERS file.

Note: we fixed also an update problem of the ruby package

Feature backports:
==================

* none

Changes:
========

* build: vminit can now be installed for multiple architectures in parallel on
         OBS server.
* api: Interconnect supports to use credentials as part of the remoteurl.
       Note: the url must not use /public suffix in that case

Bugfixes:
=========

* build: fixed regression using build host rpm instead of the version from chroot
* backend: fixed binary rpm cache handling for image building via interconnect
