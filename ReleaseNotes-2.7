# Open Build Service 2.7
#

Please read the README.SETUP file for initial installation
instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

  http://openbuildservice.org/download/

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

dist/README.UPDATERS file has informations for updaters.

OBS Appliance users who have setup their LVM can just replace 
their appliance image without data loss. The migration will 
happen automatically.

OBS 2.7 will be the last release supporting SLES 11 as OS for the server installation.

Features
========

 * Incremental storage of sources from upstream SCM systems
   - cpio archives are stored incremental and offered the to the build job
     as directory.
   - The default git handling has been changed to use obs_scm service which 
     produces the right format.
 * Reworked download on demand support
   - supports changing repositories now
   - webui has support to add remote repositories
 * Support tracking of github issues
 * Instantiate package api call for projects building service packs 
 * Source services can be used during build time
   - they get executed before the packaging tool (eg. rpm-build) gets started
 * Support to use docker as virtualization engine
 * Support for simple image creation
 * New option to avoid usage of defined repositories when branching a package
   via the OBS:BranchSkipRepositories attribute
 * New hardware architectures are supported: k1om, aarch64_ilp32
 * Many improvements in the maintenance support features
 * Groups can have an email adress for notifications and contact
 * Improved scheduler speed
 * New waitservice and mergeservice commands to handle _service files
 * Allow non-obs urls in kiwi, map to obs urls if possible
 * collax package format support
 * Support virt-builder repository meta data

Incompatible Changes
====================

 * Repository meta data and packages are now signed with sha256 instead of sha1 if RSA is used
 * Users are allowed to add themself in their home project, even when they got removed.
   Admins can set the user state to "locked" when they do want to block them.
 * request "addrevision" option is using unexpanded revision when "updatelink" option is used
 * package search for bug issues in attributes is done via own attribute_issue xpath attribute.
   the search api used to match source and attribute issues via same xpath attribute before
 * "download" elements have been moved to "repository" elements and got a new syntax in project xml.

Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here and not the service status.

Also stopping services may not terminate all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to by-pass systemd:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start
