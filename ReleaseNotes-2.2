instructions or use the OBS Appliance from

There is also an install medium with installs OBS on hard disc now.

happen automatically.


Existing problems which need to be fixed before 2.2 final release
=================================================================

* webui is generating corrupt project meta data -> add repo is failing
* webui is caching also secret data, exposing hidden projects.


Known Regressions to 2.1:
=========================


Features:
=========

* web interface improvements:
  - package filtering
  - IChain host configurable

* api
  - review of requests by project or package maintainers is possible now (FATE #310806)
  - better Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection

* backend:


Changes:
========

* web interface
  - bug reporting for projects/packages is only possible if a bugowner is set

* api
  - It was not possible so far to create submit requests from packages where no write access exists.
    This is possible now, but the source package maintainer will get asked for review the request.


Requirements:
=============

* The OBS server should not run on a system with less than 2GB memory. 
  4GB is recommended, esp. when the same system is also building packages.

* Use osc 0.130 or later to get access to the new features.

* Usage of Ruby on Rails version 2.3.8 is mandatory.
