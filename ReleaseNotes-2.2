Known Regressions to 2.1:
=========================


Features:
=========

* web interface improvements:

* api
  - review of requests by project or package maintainers is possible now (FATE #310806)

* backend:


Changes:
========

* api
  - It was not possible so far to create submit requests from packages where no write access exists.
    This is possible now, but the source package maintainer will get asked for review the request.


Requirements:
=============

* The OBS server should not run on a system with less than 2GB memory. 
  4GB is recommended, esp. when the same system is also building packages.

* Use osc 0.130 or later to get access to the new features.
