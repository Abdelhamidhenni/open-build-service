=========
TODO List
=========

This file collects ideas, open issues, proposed changes and goals for future
releases of the Build Service.


High priority
=============

- job scheduler with priorities
- quota handling (size of project repos)
- enable all build hosts with XEN
- find a solution for provo instance updates
  (Allow binary rpm upload via API ?)


Medium priority
===============

- src copy (or should this happen on API / client side ?)

  - with src link handling

- build time quota ?
- clarify how to store patterns and distribution descriptions (KIWI)
- disable / manual package release mechanism
- xml data cleanup, remove unused fields
- fast boot strapping
- Submit sources from autobuild STABLE for Factory / Core

  - possibility to merge back contributions as second step


Low priority
============

- rebuild reason logging
- renaming

  * packages (this is easy)
  * repositories?
  * projects?

- build still idle check
- build still running check
- clean up config

  * centralize in one place, like /etc/sysconfig/obs, that is used by everything
  * service locations
  * directories

- clean up log files

  * centralize in /srv/obs/log or even better /var/log/obs/

- start in screen

  * see obsworker for how so
  * document

- split package along the lines of 'can run on own machine'
- clean up source package

  * remove stale files
  * figure how rails apps are usually maintained / installed and how that maps
    to rpm distributed apps
  * take files from tar ball instead of %SOURCE xyz, move them into a subdir
    for that.

- add sandboxed smoke test

  * start a build service and test build "hello.rpm" or "obs-server.src.rpm" in it

- fix ports, currently:

  * 5352 -> SR in Hex "source repo"
  * 5252 -> RR in Hex "rpm repo"
  * 6352, 6252 have been internal test instances
  * So there is no need to stay with the existing port numbers while
    finding more appropriate official ones.

- "deleted" project in the backend is a feature...
