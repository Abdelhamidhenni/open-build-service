Features
========

 * Entire projects can be linked now with frozen source revisions.

 * webui handles package sources supporting project links.

Changes on purpose:
===================

 *

Incompatible changes:
=====================

 * You get also an update of sphinx searchd. The on-disk db files became 
   incompatible, so please remove all files in following directory to
   enforce a re-index to avoid problems:

      /srv/www/obs/api/db/sphinx/production/ 

Notes for systems using systemd:
================================

OBS is using init scripts, not systemd style .service files. This will stay until
we will switch from SLES 11 to SLES 12 as default production platform.

openSUSE installations may use systemd (instead of sysvinit) and it should work
in general. Not working are usages like

 # rcobssrcserver status

You will only get the systemd status here.

Also stopping services may not kill all processes, which leads to abstract errors
when trying to restart them. We heard also about trashed MySQL databases when using
systemd.

To avoid these problems you need switch directory to avoid the systemd mapper:

 # cd /etc/init.d
 # ./obssrcserver status|stop|start
